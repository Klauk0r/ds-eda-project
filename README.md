# EDA of the King County Housing Market for Amy Williams

This repository contains my first EDA project, an analysis of a dataset of house sales for a mock customer.


## Objective
This repository contains an EDA on the King County housing market. It goes through cleaning and feature engineering, correlational analyses, and visualisation of descriptive and geospatial data.

Set up a virtual environment with the following code:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
